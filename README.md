- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martin-e-k
- 🌱 I recently graduated from DTU with a Msc in Bioinformatics and systems biology.
- 💞️ I’m interested in biology and data science. I have experience with Python and R aswell as bash scripting and high performance computing. I am specialized in metagenomics and other NGS data analysis, but I am ready to pick up other kinds of interesting datasets.
- 👀 I’m currently looking to find an exciting job within my field of interest. 
- ✨ Feel free to look through my repositories to get an idea og my programming skills.
