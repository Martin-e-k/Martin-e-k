👋 Hi, I’m @Martin-e-k

✨ I’m a Bioinformatician working with clinical genetics at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Amager & Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark

🤝 Together with a skilled molecular biology team, I deliver genetic insights that support clinical decision-making

🧬 I work at the interface of genomics, diagnostics, and data science, using tools like Python, R, Snakemake, and Bash scripting

🛠️ As the responsible bioinformatician, I spend much of my time creating and validating data analysis pipelines — focusing on reliability, reproducibility, and ease of use for our lab technicians

👶 A current area of interest is method development in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) — improving test resolution, fetal fraction estimation, and reliability in dizygotic twin pregnancies
