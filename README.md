- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martin-e-k
- ✨ I am a Bioinformatics researcher at InnovPlantProtect (InPP).
- 🌱 At InPP we develop new biological alternatives to chemical pestisides and growth promoters.
- 💞️ In collaboration with the awesome lab researches, I study the genomic information of crops, pathogens, soils and biological agents that can help farmers have high yields while decreasing the use chemical compounds. Additionally, I develop and maintain data pipelines to increase automation and repreduceability of our analysis.
