- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martin-e-k
- ✨ I am a Bioinformatics researcher at InnovPlantProtect (InPP).
- 🌱 At InPP we develop new biological alternatives to chemical pesticides and growth promoters.
- 💞️ In collaboration with the awesome lab researchers, I study the genomic information of crops, pathogens, soils, and biological agents that can help farmers have high yields while decreasing the use of chemical compounds. Additionally, I develop and maintain data pipelines to increase the automation and reproducibility of our analysis.
- 👀 Feel free to look through my repositories. I mainly work with Python, R, and Bash scripting. I have experience with high-performance computing and I am looking to improve my skills in workflow management using Snakemake or Nextflow.
